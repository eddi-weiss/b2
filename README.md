## How to Contribute

The simplest way of contributing is probably to report issues. You can do so using the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sourcepit/b2/issues).

If you want to contribute your code or just want to share it with others, you [can create a fork of the official
repository](https://github.com/sourcepit/b2/fork) at any time, for which you will have full access so that your local
changesets can be pushed to it.

Once your code is ready and accepted (see code style section below), it is then easy for the project owners to pull
your changesets into the official repository - all you have to do is to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

For general information see [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source).
